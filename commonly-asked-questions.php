					<h4>About Hannah <small>(9)</small></h4>

					<div class="accordion accordion-border clearfix" data-state="closed">

						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-question-sign"></i><i class="acc-open icon-question-sign"></i>Who are the owners of Hannah</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Hannah the Pet Society is a closely held private company founded by Dr. Scott Campbell. There are 50 or so Pet lovers who are veterinarians and small private investors who love Pets that have funded the company.</div>

						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-comments-alt"></i><i class="acc-open icon-comments-alt"></i>Why did the founders start Hannah?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Hannah was started by people who care very much about Pets – and care that many are being put to sleep unnecessarily. They know that many families could benefit from having a Pet as part of their family but don’t because of the multiple barriers and high costs of Pet care. Hannah is designed to overcome those barriers. Because of their concern for Pets and their strong desire to “give back,” these individuals are heavily supporting Hannah in every way possible.</div>

						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-lock3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-lock3"></i>Why is the name of the organization "Hannah The Pet Society?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Hannah the Pet Society finds its roots in rural Eastern Oregon. Dr. Campbell’s mother’s first name was Johannah, but her close friends and family shortened her name to “Hannah.” Hannah was a dedicated nurse who also cared for every lost or stray, hurt or sick, large or small, wild or domestic animal that crossed her path. She always found a way to help even when things looked impossible. She understood the importance of proper Pet care and went to great lengths to instill that knowledge, belief and behavior in everyone she met. Because of her example, her eldest son, Scott, started caring for Pets and injured wild animals at a very young age and had decided to become a veterinarian by the time he was 7. That devotion to his mother’s high ideals inspired Dr. Campbell to create the largest and most caring veterinary practice in the world – Banfield. This is the reason he has now created “Hannah the Pet Society” in honor of his mom – to truly make Pet care affordable without sacrificing quality. We tested the name with consumers and they were not confused with any other commonly used names.</div>
						
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-comments-alt"></i><i class="acc-open icon-comments-alt"></i>Will Hannah do joint marketing with a shelter partner?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Yes, if desired by the shelter partner, Hannah the Pet Society will consider joint marketing – as long as the marketing is consistent and compatible with the Hannah brand. We would create a comprehensive plan and approach to such an arrangement that worked for both organizations.</div>
						
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-comments-alt"></i><i class="acc-open icon-comments-alt"></i>Why is Hannah a "For-Profit" rather than a "Nonprofit" business?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Hannah is a for-profit business with a clear social mission to keep Pets out of shelters by keeping them physically and mentally healthy so that they stay with their loving families for life. Being “for-profit” or “not-for-profit” doesn’t set the philosophy of the business – and a nonprofit is really just a different way to raise money or pay taxes.</div>
						
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-comments-alt"></i><i class="acc-open icon-comments-alt"></i>Is Banfield connected to Hannah in any way?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">No. Banfield is a traditional “fee for service” veterinary care provider and the best in the world at what it does. Hannah provides managed Pet care through a unique model to families and provides all the medical and behavior care they need for life. It’s a completely different business – even a different category – and has no common ownership or management with Banfield.</div>

						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-comments-alt"></i><i class="acc-open icon-comments-alt"></i>Is Hannah a competitor to other veterinarians?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Hannah employs great veterinarians and expects to employ many more. We believe a high percentage of our Members wouldn’t even have a Pet without Hannah making it affordable for them. Hannah simply provides another choice for Pet Parents.</div>
						
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-comments-alt"></i><i class="acc-open icon-comments-alt"></i>The Hannah Doctors' Oath:</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Hannah veterinarians promise to never recommend unnecessary care and always recommend what’s best for you and your Hannah Pet, which we will provide without regard to cost.</div>
												
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-comments-alt"></i><i class="acc-open icon-comments-alt"></i>The Hannah Promise to Members:</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix"><ul>
								<li>To do our best to help your Hannah Pet live the longest, healthiest, happiest life possible with your family at a reasonable and sustainable cost.</li>
								<li>To do our best to keep you and your Hannah Pet family safe by initially testing the Hannah Pet for potentially dangerous behavior problems, by prevention of any recognized zoonotic disease, and by treatment and resolution of problems as quickly as we can if any are ever found.</li>
								<li>To support you and your Hannah Pet family with expert veterinary care and compassionate consultation through sickness and health. To always work together to determine the care that is appropriate, necessary, and timely.
</li>
								<li>To do our best to create a happy healthy relationship between your family and your Hannah Pet through veterinary care, Pet health education, behavior support, and caring attention. We will be available for advice 24-7-365 and find you an emergency Pet hospital or other resource if one is ever medically appropriate and we cannot provide it ourselves.</li>
								<li>To carefully listen to the requests and concerns of you and your family regarding your Hannah Pet and respond in a respectful, thoughtful way.</li>
								<li>To be the reason you and your family truly enjoy the love and companionship of a Pet now and for the rest of your lives.</li>

					<h4 class="topmargin">Hannah's Business Model <small>(1)</small></h4>

					<div class="accordion accordion-border nobottommargin clearfix" data-state="closed">

						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-download-alt"></i><i class="acc-open icon-download-alt"></i>How can Hannah offer its service package so cost-efficiently?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">There are several significant efficiencies assumed in our business model. Many business models rely on “volume,” and Hannah the Pet Society isn’t an exception. We will need several thousand Hannah Pets in order to gain efficiencies such as buying Pet food and supplies at high-volume, wholesale prices. Additionally, we believe our Health & Education Centers will need to be reasonably convenient to our Pets’ homes but not necessarily in high-traffic and expensive retail locations that Pet food stores, groomers and veterinarians typically require. Therefore, we will save on real estate costs by locating in areas that are convenient but not nearly as expensive as traditional retail locations. In addition, by owning the Pets, Hannah saves regulatory costs versus an insurance model and has tax benefits by being able to depreciate the costs of the Pets over time. These all help lower the costs to Hannah Pet Parents.</div>

						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-picture"></i><i class="acc-open icon-picture"></i>What is the Total Lifetime Care &amp; Companionship (TLC) Plan?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">The Total Lifetime Care & Companionship (TLC) Plan is an all-inclusive program including veterinary care, behavior care, prescriptions, obedience training and support – all for a set monthly fee. You can customize your plan with things like food delivered to your home, flea/tick treatments, and Pet pickup and delivery services for additional fees. The TLC Plan is available to anyone who already has a dog or cat, or who receives a bunny or guinea pig from Hannah. This innovative, new approach allows Pet lovers to enjoy their Pets without worrying about the unexpected costs of medical care – all you add is love!</div>

						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-file3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-file3"></i>What are the costs associated with Hannah The Pet Society?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">							
						<p>Fees paid by all Pet Parent Members:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>A "Lifetime Membership Fee" to join the Hannah Society.  The current Membership Fee is $199, but it is discounted occasionally.  No matter how many Pets a Member signs up on a Hannah Total Lifetime Care (TLC) Plan, there is no additional Membership Fee.  The membership lasts for life, as long as the Member remains active and in good standing.</li>
							
							<li>A monthly "Total Lifetime Care & Companionship Fee" (Monthly TLC Fee) that is set based on species, breed, age and other factors, and goes up a little bit each year as the Pet ages.  Annually, cat plans go up by $0.50 per month and dog plans go up by $1 per month, plus inflation if any.  The starting Monthly TLC Fee varies a lot due to different species, ages, existing conditions, breeds, and options chosen by the Pet Parent (i.e. grooming, Pet Limo Service, etc.).  Plans starts at $59 for a healthy year-old dog and $29 for a healthy year-old cat, and covers almost everything with respect to medical and behavior care .  This TLC Fee is often adjusted if the Pet already has some existing medical condition (like arthritis or heart disease).  This increased fee is meant to cover the cost of the disease that the Pet already has before enrolling, which may be a lifelong cost.  It is best for the health of the Pet and less expensive for the Member to enroll a Pet early, before any problems get started.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Additional fees (when applicable):</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A "Healthy Start Fee" if they get a puppy or kitten, to cover the extra costs of care for a young Pet for the first year. This varies based on species and different conditions, but the top is about $40 per month for 12 months.
							</li>
							<li>A "Testing, Training, & Transportation (TTT) Fee" to cover a portion of Hannah's costs for Pets Hannah places.  This TTT Fee ranges in price for different species and conditions and covers cost of the habitat for bunnies and guinea pigs.
							</li>
							<li>An “Existing Condition or Sick or Injured Care Fee" that covers the cost of a regular veterinary bill to treat a sick or injured Pet that the owner wants to become a Hannah Pet. Only 50% of the cost is payable upfront (or at the Member’s option, over 12 months in equal monthly payments). The other 50% is only payable if the Member decides to cancel the TLC Plan (and is due at the time of cancellation).
							</li>
							<li>A “TLN Fee” (Total Lifetime Nutrition Fee) is added by most Pet Parents – so they can get Pet food (and litter for cats) delivered right to their door.  The TLN Fee varies depending upon total pounds of food (or food and litter) needed per month.
							</li>
							<li>An “option” fee.  There are many options at Hannah that you can add to customize your Pet’s TLC Plan.  They include, but are not limited to: flea/tick control, Pet pick-up and delivery, grooming services, etc.
							</li>
							<li>An "Adjusted Pet Adoption/Purchase Fee." At "sign up," Hannah and the new Hannah Pet Parent agree to the value of the Pet in case the Pet Parent would ever want to actually own it (if they move out of Hannah’s service area, etc.). For dogs, this fee is almost always $300 if the Pet Parent brings a pretty healthy dog to us (but it is more if the Pet is sick or injured when we take ownership of it). Whatever the amount is – $300 or something else – the amount goes down by $50 every year to a minimum value of $100. When Pet Parents pay this fee, they are provided with a “Bill of Sale” for the Pet that they now own and a complete medical record of everything we know about the Pet – this includes a copy of the medical records since Hannah acquired the Pet from the previous owner.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>There is no “cancellation fee” – the Member simply reimburses Hannah for the value of services Hannah gave the Member in exchange for the Pet.</p>
						
						<p style="font-style: italic;">See Membership Agreement for complete details, exceptions, and excluded diseases. Hannah will not accept vicious animals. Flea/tick and heartworm control are at an extra cost, and non-Hannah specialists and non-Hannah formulary medication are provided at 50% of cost.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i><span style="line-height: 20px;">If I can no longer care for my Pet, will Hannah see to it that my Pet gets into a good new home?</span></div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Hannah generally recommends the person wanting to re-home their Pet to keep it in their home until an appropriate Pet Parent is found to keep the stress to the Pet at a minimum. But if your Pet is accepted on a TLC Plan and you can’t keep it, we will find every adoptable Pet a new loving home.
</div>
	
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>Can people who adopt a new Pet directly from a shelter still opt in to Hannah’s service package?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Yes, assuming the Pet passes the behavioral and medical exams, and is a good match to the family and Hannah.
</div>
	
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>What is the Lifetime Matching Program?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">The Lifetime Matching Program is a state-of-the-art matching system developed with input from psychologists, veterinary behaviorists and personality testing experts. The program considers everything from lifestyle factors, Pet experience and pricing considerations, to help determine what type of Pet would be the best forever match for the family.  Hannah Members use our matching services whenever they need them – we love helping folks get another Pet.</div>
	
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>Do you find and place Pets into matching families?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">We used to, but we no longer find and provide dogs and cats for families – we do provide bunnies and guinea pigs.  However, we do still provide our Members with our matching services whenever they need them.  Our Pet match is based on the information they provide us about them and their family.  Once a Member has found the matching Pet, we will examine it and provide our complete medical, behavior, and matching assessment at no charge.  They are able to repeat this process multiple times without any cost.  With thousands of Members, there is always somebody going through a life-changing event and we help them find a great new home for their “Hannah Pet.”
</div>
	
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>If I decide to enroll my Pet with Hannah, where will I get food, supplies, medical treatment and other care from?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">For medical and behavior treatment for your Pet or other needs, you will visit one of our conveniently located Hannah Health & Education Centers, or have our Pet limo service pick up or deliver anything you need – including your Pet for its medical visits.  The Pet Limo is a service option you can add to your TLC Plan or pay for just when you need it.  If you choose food as an option on your TLC Plan, the food will be delivered to your doorstep!</div>
							
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>I love cats and every one I have had loves to go outside – but many seem to get lost. If I enroll my cat with Hannah, can it still go outside?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Our Pet care guidelines specify that cats that stay indoors are likely to be healthier and live longer. The reality is that cats do on occasion escape outside, and we want to help Pet Parents understand that keeping the cat indoors will result in a healthier Pet. We also provide education on ways for cats to play and exercise while indoors to minimize the desire to escape. But, perhaps most importantly, all Hannah Pets are microchipped and registered as a part of the Hannah Total Lifetime Care Plan. This provides assurance for Hannah Pet Parents that if their Pet is lost or stolen, we have the processes in place so authorities can identify the Pet, and we can get the Pet back to the family as soon as possible; you are responsible for licensing and any “tickets” you get if your Hannah Pet is picked up off your property.</div>
							
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>How do you deal with older Pets that are given to you by a Member, or in cases when the Member dies and the Pet has nowhere else to go or has medical problems?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Remember, we already have the Pet’s complete medical and behavioral record so if we match it with a new Pet Family, we know they are willing to spend the time it takes to provide care. And because we take care of all the medical care costs, this is not a barrier to anyone.</div>
							
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>What keeps a Hannah Pet Parent from dropping off a Pet they no longer want at a shelter?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Hannah the Pet Society makes it easy to give us a Pet on a TLC Plan that the Pet Parent no longer wants or can no longer properly care for. A Pet Parent just needs to notify us of their wishes, help us with a questionnaire that will make it easier to properly take care of the Pet, and we’ll either pick up the Pet from their home or they can drop it off at one of our Health & Education Centers. If a Hannah Pet is dropped off at a shelter, the shelter will know to contact Hannah due to the microchip we implant in every one of our Pets and we will retrieve it immediately.</div>
							
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>What type of veterinary care can I expect from Hannah?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">At Hannah, our veterinarians are the best in the business and provide the same high-quality care as their counterparts in the Portland area. Hannah veterinarians and their medical teams have state-of-the-art facilities at our Health & Education Centers. You will be as active as you want to be in the decision-making about the care your Hannah Pet receives.</div>
													
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>How can Hannah ensure “Hannah Pets” are being cared for properly?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">We educate all new Pet Parents to ensure they have the information they need to properly care for their Pet. We also have regular communication with Pet Parents via care calls to make sure they have the support they need to be successful. By having a high level of communication, we can ensure that Hannah Pet Parents have everything they need to provide great care to their Pets. Regular veterinary exams and preventive care visits – all included in a Monthly TLC Fee – also help to ensure the Pet has a great quality of life.</div>
																			
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>How does Hannah ensure the Pet receives the required minimum veterinary care?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">The Monthly TLC Fee includes all the costs of veterinary care so the most common barrier to care – an unexpected expense – has been removed. The medical record system, just like in most veterinary hospitals, provides reminders to the medical team and Pet Parents of routine care that is needed. We even have a Pet pickup and delivery service!</div>
																									
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>I have gone to the same veterinarian for over 30 years and have a wonderful relationship with him because he’s just a great vet – why can’t I take my Hannah Pet to him after I join Hannah?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Because Hannah’s Total Lifetime Care (TLC) Plan already covers all the medical and behavior care the Pet will need, and we can deliver care more efficiently and at a lower price than it would cost you otherwise – that’s why it costs less than insurance.  Maybe you should tell him to apply at Hannah’s!</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>I’ve had Pets for many years and have always fed my dogs Science Diet with great results. All of my Labs have lived to be at least 10 years old. I love the Hannah concept but really want to purchase the Science Diet myself for my Pet. Can I do that?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Yes.  But as an option on our TLC Plans, you can include our Total Lifetime Nutrition (TLN) Program – Pet food that is carefully selected to ensure your Pet remains healthy and happy for as long as possible –– and it’s delivered regularly right to your door! If you choose not to take advantage of this element of our program, we can recommend Pet food options that are suitable based on the Pet’s blood work, age and general condition.  Science Diet is a pretty good food, but you might want to try TLN – we think it’s better and it costs less!</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>When will I have to pick up my Hannah Pet food?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">You don’t. The Hannah Nutrition Program option includes delivery directly to your home. We’ll call you a day or two before we deliver to your home and remind you that we will be dropping off your Hannah Pet’s food. If you should need any Pet food prior to our normal delivery, just call us and you can pick it up at the Health & Education Center – we request 7 days’ notice to change your standing order.  Special deliveries within our delivery area have a $15 fee or can be picked up at the Health & Education Center with no fee.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>What if my Hannah Pet is sick and I am unable to take it to the Health & Education Center?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Don’t worry. Your TLC Plan may already include pick-up and delivery services. Even if it doesn’t, Hannah can provide pick-up and delivery of the Pet for a small fee when you need it. Or, you can add pick-up and delivery service to your customized TLC Plan at any time.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>What if my Pet gets sick and needs emergency care after hours?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">You can call a Hannah PetNurse on our toll-free number any time, night or day (24-7-365 days a year), and discuss the situation with the PetNurse. In the event of a need for emergency medical services at a location other than Hannah’s, our PetNurse will make immediate arrangements and all emergency costs and medical care will be covered by Hannah.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>What happens if a Hannah Pet is injured and the Pet Parent takes it to an emergency clinic instead of to Hannah – who pays the bill?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">If you are in the local area, call us and we will make arrangements for you at a specific emergency hospital for care where everything will be paid for by Hannah. Hannah Pet Parents who are traveling outside of the local area call our emergency number for medical support, and we will work with the nearest suitable emergency hospital to coordinate care and resolve payment. If you take a Hannah Pet to any clinic for lifesaving emergency aid, Hannah always pays for it; however, if you don’t bring Hannah into the conversation immediately so that we can make sure the Hannah Pet is getting the appropriate care, it will be your expense.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>If my Hannah Pet accidently gets run over by a truck and killed, do I have to pay the repurchase fee?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">You would not have to pay for the Pet in this case, if we determine that you weren’t at fault or if your Pet dies under normal circumstances.  Hannah has several easy ways you can prove that your Hannah Pet died and then the monthly TLC Plan payments will stop immediately.  In cases where your Hannah Pet dies, you should call Hannah immediately so we can take care of the Pet’s remains for you.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>If the Hannah Pet Parent moves outside of your service area, what happens to the Pet?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Hannah Pet Parents consider their Pet a member of their family and naturally want to keep the Pet with them no matter where they live. When the Member moves outside of our service area we can no longer provide services, so our Membership Agreement has a couple of very easy ways the Member can end their relationship with Hannah and regain ownership of their Pet. If for some reason the Pet Parent can’t take the Pet with them (e.g. Active Military Service), we will help them find the Pet a new loving home.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>I am in the military and really want to get a Hannah Pet; however, I worry about being deployed overseas and I might not be able to take my Pet. Could I leave it with my brother for the two years I might be gone?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Yes. Arrangements can be made for Pets to stay with family members or extended family members. We want to do everything we can to ensure the Pet gets the best possible continuity of care.  Hannah’s Helping Hands, a nonprofit sister organization, has programs to help people in the military with their Pets, if needed.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>My boyfriend and I are getting married and would like to become Hannah Pet Parents as soon as we move into our new house. Suppose we get divorced someday; what will happen to our Pet?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Hannah works with our Pet Parents as they resolve rights and responsibilities such as in the case of a divorce. Ultimately, a court may make this determination, and of course we will abide by that. Hannah will not take sides and will support the family’s agreement or the court’s decision. We will also waive the Membership Fee and provide free matching consultations if the noncustodial Pet Parent wants a Pet.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>What if a customer misses payments? Will you repossess the Pet?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">No.  Hannah will never repossess a Pet for any reason. Our first option will be to work with the Hannah Pet Parent to develop a payment plan. If that is unsuccessful or if the Pet Parent ceases communication with us, we will refer them to our collection agency.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>Can non-members bring their Pets into Hannah service centers for grooming, boarding, vet care, etc.? If not, why not?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">No. Our Hannah Health & Education Centers are exclusively for Hannah members. We sometimes make exceptions for training classes and programs for kids like 4-H and Scouting, and for shelter Pets.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>Will your prices ever change during the lifetime of my Hannah Pet?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Yes.  The repurchase price of the Pet goes down by $50 per year to a minimum of $100, and the monthly TLC Plan fee will be adjusted annually based on the age of the Pet and inflation (CPI). We don’t anticipate other changes, but can’t see into the future.  What we will never do is raise the monthly price for your Hannah Pet just because it got sick or developed a problem after it was already on a TLC Plan.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>Hannah says that Total Lifetime Care (TLC) Plans basically cover everything that a Pet “needs.”  What happens when Hannah and the Pet Parent don’t agree on “need”?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">If we think that the Pet needs medical or behavior care and not having that product or service is affecting the Pet negatively or could be detrimental in a material way, we will tell you and recommend what we think is best – as we would for our own Pet.  If you disagree with our professional recommendation and refuse to allow or help us to provide what we determine the Pet needs, we have the right to end your Membership Agreement with Hannah.  Conversely, if you think the Pet needs medical or behavior care and that not having that product or service is affecting the Pet negatively or could be detrimental in a material way, you will tell us and explain what you think is best for the Pet and why.  We will fully consider all your points, get other doctor’s opinions and so forth, and discuss all the data and opinions with you; but if we still disagree with your diagnosis and therapeutic plan or refuse to provide it for any reason, you have the right to end your Membership Agreement with Hannah (as documented in Section R of that agreement).</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>Hannah’s behavior standards for a “good” Pet may be different than a shelter’s evaluation. How is this reconciled?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Hannah the Pet Society’s behavior standards are intended to ensure that a Pet has a high likelihood of longevity in a particular family setting. A standard definition of “good” doesn’t currently exist and should be based on the goals of the organization.  We choose to error on the side of safety – for you, your family and friends, and our team of caregivers.  Pets that are aggressive and/or biters, in our opinion, are not safe and are not accepted as Hannah Pets, and we don’t recommend them as Pets.  Even a little bite can put out a child’s eye.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>If Hannah refers me to a shelter and I get a matching Pet from them, will the shelter perform spay/neuter and microchipping, or will Hannah?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">It can be done by either. Hannah the Pet Society has clinical facilities to support spay/neuter and microchipping, and so we are able to have agreements with shelters that are flexible to determine which is best in each situation.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>Most shelter animals have kennel cough – who will be responsible for cleaning up pre-existing conditions in the Pet  – Hannah, the shelter, or me?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">All Pets that are accepted on a TLC Plan first need to pass Hannah’s medical and behavior examination and, as such, some Pets with serious illness may not be able to be placed on a plan until their condition is resolved. Once a Pet has been accepted by Hannah on a TLC Plan, Hannah the Pet Society is responsible for all medical care.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>It’s great that your Pet Aptitude Test (PAT) evaluates Pets for behavior, but what about health measures? What will Hannah’s health and wellness evaluations cover?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Hannah the Pet Society conducts a medical exam to ensure that the Pet is in good health. This includes a physical exam and important laboratory tests when necessary.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>If a shelter is already using a behavior/temperament test in-house that works for them, will Hannah also insist on separate administration of the PAT before enrolling a Pet on a TLC Plan?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Yes; we each may have different purposes for such a test.  Hannah the Pet Society’s Pet Aptitude Test (PAT) is focused on helping to determine if a Pet is appropriate in a family environment and in our facilities. It may be similar or a complement to any temperament testing currently being done by the shelter, but the PAT can’t be replaced by current temperament testing done by shelters.</div>
																															
						<div class="acctitle"><i class="acc-closed icon-phone3"></i><i class="acc-open icon-phone3"></i>Are Hannah Pet Parents encouraged to make donations to the shelter that provided the Pet? Will Hannah facilitate this donation?</div>
						<div class="acc_content clearfix">Yes; we give our Members the opportunity to include a donation from them to the shelter they got their Pet from in their monthly TLC Plan fee if that shelter is a Hannah Shelter Partner. Hannah the Pet Society works with each shelter partner to determine the best arrangement for such donations to ensure that they go to the right place.</div>
