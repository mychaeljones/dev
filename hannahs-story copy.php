									<p>Hannah the Pet Society was the mother of our founder, Dr. Scott Campbell.  (Her given name was Johannah, but her family and close friends shortened it to Hannah). </p>
									
									<p>Hannah was a dedicated nurse who cared for every ost or stray, hurt or sick, larte or small, wild or domestic that crossed her path.  she always found a way to help, even when it seemed impossible.</p>
									
									<p>Her love for animals and belief that every Pet deserved loving care inspired her son to become a veterinarian and to create Hannah teh Pet Society in honor of his amazing mom.</p>

							<h3>WHY IS HANNAH CALLED A <span>SOCIETY?</span></h3>
							
							<div class="clearfix">
								<p>Dr. Campbell asked his friends and family to join him in his effort to create a group or society that would help to stop Pets from needlessly being put to sleep in shelters, and then - as his mother would have - provide a lifeime of care and support for those Pets.  He wanted to form a group of Pet-Parents that wanted to become a part of a society of people with a genuine love of Pets and a sincere interest in making sure that they receive unmatched care for a lifetime.</p>
