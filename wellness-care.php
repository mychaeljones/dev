								<h3 class="bottommargin-xs">Dentals</h3>
								<p>Dogs and cats need regular dental care - it’s critical for their long-term health. Even with consistent brushing to remove plaque, Pets periodically require more thorough cleaning and procedures to treat periodontal disease, fractured teeth or oral masses. For the safety of your Pet and to provide the best care possible, dental procedures always take place under general anesthesia. For your Pet’s comfort, we utilize the most current pain-control protocols before, during, and after the procedure.</p>
