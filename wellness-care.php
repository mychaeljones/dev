							<h3>Wellness Care</h3>
							<img class="alignright img-responsive" src="images/wellness/wellness.jpg" alt="">
							<p>Along with your careful observations at home, regular wellness exams from our medical team at Hannah the Pet Society are the best way to keep your Hannah Pet happy and healthy.

Wellness Exams for Dogs and Cats
During your Pet’s wellness exam our team will:
·   Obtain a medical history and check your Pet’s weight and vital signs
·   Perform a complete physical examination and dental evaluation
·   Protect your Pet from infectious diseases through a personalized approach based on the age, health, exposure and environment of your Pet
·   Screen for the presence of parasites in blood and stool
·   Recommend safe medications to treat and prevent parasites
·   Discuss your Pet’s nutritional needs and behavioral issues

Preparing Your Pet for Their Visit
For the safety of your Pet and the other Members and Pets, please keep dogs on a leash or in a secure carrier. For the safety of your cat, they should be transported in a secure carrier. You can help your cat become comfortable with the carrier placing it in a room where they spend a lot of time.
For questions about our canine and feline wellness exams or to schedule an appointment for your Pet, please call us at 360-816-8000.</p>

							<h3>Emergency Care</h3>
							<img class="alignright img-responsive" src="images/wellness/emergency.jpg" alt="">
							<p>Hannah the Pet Society provides emergency services 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

							<h3>Dentals</h3>
							<p>Dogs and cats need regular dental care - it’s critical for their long-term health. Even with consistent brushing to remove plaque, Pets periodically require more thorough cleaning and procedures to treat periodontal disease, fractured teeth or oral masses. For the safety of your Pet and to provide the best care possible, dental procedures always take place under general anesthesia. For your Pet’s comfort, we utilize the most current pain-control protocols before, during, and after the procedure.</p>

							<ul>
								<strong>Our professional teeth cleaning and advanced dental care for Pets includes:</strong>
								<li>Oral/dental exams																				  </li>
								<li>Comprehensive dental cleanings, polishing and fluoride treatments								  </li>
								<li>Minor oral surgery including extractions, fistula repairs and removal of oral tumors			  </li>
								<li>Comprehensive pain management before, during and after all oral procedures						  </li>
								<li>Anesthesia monitoring by specially-trained Pet nurses with the aid of digital monitoring equipment</li>
								<li>Home dental care instructions																	  </li>
							</ul>

							<p>At-Home Dental Care
Regular home dental care will prevent the buildup of plaque on your Pet’s teeth. Brushing your Pet’s teeth daily significantly reduces the buildup of plaque on the teeth. Call us today to learn more - we can help you find the option that works best for you and your Pet.</p>

							<h3>Radiology &amp; Ultrasound</h3>
							<p>Radiology (you might just call it X-ray!) is an imaging tool that our veterinarians use to examine your Pet’s cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, reproductive and urinary systems. We use radiology to diagnose broken bones, locate foreign objects within the body, and screen for cancer and organ abnormalities.</p>

							<p>An ultrasound is a non-invasive test that allows our veterinarians to visualize the internal organs and to aid in guiding needles for biopsy. With ultrasound, we can quickly locate and assess tumors, cysts, stones, inflammation and disease within most organ systems.</p>
